#  Data Extraction with JavaScript & Regular Expressions

This project demonstrates how to extract different types of structured data (like emails, URLs, phone numbers, etc.) from large bodies of text using JavaScript and Regular Expressions.

It was built as part of a university assignment where we simulate building an API that collects web data and extracts useful information from raw text.

---

##  Project Overview

The project uses JavaScript to parse and extract 8 common types of information from string data:

1. **Email Addresses**
2. **URLs**
3. **Phone Numbers**
4. **Credit Card Numbers**
5. **Time (12-hour and 24-hour format)**
6. **HTML Tags**
7. **Hashtags**
8. **Currency Amounts**

The extracted data can be printed to the console for further use in APIs or applications.
